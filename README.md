# Android-Thermal-Bluetooth-Print
The app developed by Saeed Khalafinejad from Kasabeh Accounting Software Group for printing from Android to Bluetooth thermal printers. (Kasabeh means businessmen).

# Description

This app demonstrates how you can print from an Android device to portable Bluetooth thermal printers.
The library for printing is located at the `org.kasabeh.androidprint.lib` package. You can easily reuse the 
package in your own project. Some notes about the project:

* The app works with all ESC/POS commands friendly printers.
* We have tested the app on Bixolon, Woosim, Sewoo, Baby and Rongta printers.
* Based on the implementation, the app should support almost all Bluetooth printers.
* If you find any printer that is not supported by the app then you need to extends the `WoosimPrnMng` class
  based on the unsupported printer documentations.
* Besides English characters, the app also supports Farsi/Arabic characters.
* For other languages, based on the font installed on the device, you need to implement your owner character mapper
  (Similar to the `WCharMapperCT42` class).
* The printing library here is used in [Kasabeh Pocket Accounting Software](https://cafebazaar.ir/app/ilia.anrdAcunt.ui?l=en) for printing invoices and person's transactions (Kasabeh means businessmen in Farsi). See this
  Gist: [the application of the library package in a real project](https://gist.github.com/saeed-khalafinejad/d1ca60aca007474aa7b23f036113020d).

# How to Print

First, implement the `IPrintToPrinter` interface:

```java
    public class TestPrinter implements IPrintToPrinter {
        ...
        @Override
        public void printContent(WoosimPrnMng prnMng) {
            prnMng.printStr("Header", 2, WoosimCmd.ALIGN_CENTER);
            prnMng.printStr("1-First line", 1, WoosimCmd.ALIGN_LEFT);
            prnMng.printStr("2-Second line", 1, WoosimCmd.ALIGN_LEFT);
            prnMng.printNewLine();
            prnMng.printStr("Footer", 1, WoosimCmd.ALIGN_CENTER);
        }
        ...
    }
```

Then, instantiate the print manager class to make the Bluetooth connection and to issue the print command:

```java
    ...
    IPrintToPrinter testPrinter = new TestPrinter(this);
    //The below command makes a connection to the printer and after successful connection issues the print command.
    mPrnMng = printerFactory.createPrnMng(this, blutoothAddr, testPrinter);
    ...
```

# App Screenshot
To test the app, just choose your printer brand and press the print button.
